This project comes from a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-kernels-only
My notebook show how I classified the species of trees in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado with a Random Forest and an Extra Trees algorithms.
I did some feature engineering to faster the training and improve results.
I continue with tuning the classifiers.
